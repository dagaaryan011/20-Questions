# PDF-based RAG using Qwen

This project uses a PDF-based knowledge base and the Qwen model for creating a retrieval-augmented chatbot. The agent responds to yes/no questions based on the content of the book in the PDF, providing hints about the genre or author, and if the guess is close to the book's title, the agent declares a win.
